/// libyara asks to call `yr_initialize` before use the library.
/// Because yara keeps a count of how many times `yr_initialize` is used,
/// it doesn't matter if this struct is constructed multiple times.
///
/// However, since we already keep a count on how many `InitializationToken` instances there are on
/// a thread, we only call yr_initialize and yr_finalize once per thread.
///
/// To call yr_finalize_thread (required until Yara 3.8.0), we store a number of
/// `InitializationToken` living in each thread. When this number reaches 0, we call
/// yr_finalize_thread.
